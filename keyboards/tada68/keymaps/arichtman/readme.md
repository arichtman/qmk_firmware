# Switching Colemak/Qwerty TADA68 layout

Switch between custom colemak layout and stock qwerty with right FN + Escape

## General approach
	- Movement should be minimized
	- All printable characters should have some alternate hold functionality.
	- Move rarely used keys to further locations or layers.
	- Where possible function layers should relate to the base layer character/functionality
	- All modifier keys should have an alt tap function

## Colemak changes and features
	- Added all-in-one dynamic macro key
	- Replaced Caps lock with Backspace
	- Caps lock [backspace], and Space apply function layer when held
	- Enter / control combo
	- Function + Q closes program
	- Function + P screencaptures
	- Function + F alt-tabs
	- Replaced WASD function layer movement with document navigation
	- Moved and simplified backlighting controls
	- Moved volume control location
	- Brackets use tapdance to print all types
	- Tap-and-hold keys will act as tap if interrupted by another keypress [permissive hold]
	- Added function layer movement to right side (VI style)
	- Controls for auto-shift functionality [toggle, adjust, print]
	- Escape shared key [grave escape]
	- Easier function shortcuts for common hotkey combinations [ctrl z x c v]
